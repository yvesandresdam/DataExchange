    5. ACTIVITIES
    -------------
    1. Download the .cs files (C#) in the platform . You should translate them to
    English (thatâ€™s to say, name of methods/properties/members/variables,
    and then convert them into JAVA format (the easiest way to do that is to
    paste them into a new project/file in IntelliJ IDEA and compile to detect
    the differences between C# and JAVA.

    2. In exercise 1, add two more classes: AlumnoFCT and AlumnoErasmus. Both
    of them must inherit from Alumno. AlumnoFCT will have three specific
    attributes: empresa, tutor e instructor (the three of them are strings).
    AlumnoErasmus will have the starting and ending date of the internship,
    and the origin country.
